/**
 * A simple implementation of RecordProcessor that accepts records from an Amazon
 * Kinesis stream and batches them into 1 MB (configurable) datasets, then puts
 * them in a configured S3 bucket for further offline processing. The object
 * returned should implement the functions initialize, processRecords, and shutdown
 * in order to enable the KCL to interact with MultiLangDaemon.
 * MultiLangDaemon would create one child process (hence one RecordProcessor instance)
 * per shard. A single shard will never be accessed by more than one
 * RecordProcessor instance; e.g., if you run this sample on a single machine,
 * against a stream with 2 shards, MultiLangDaemon would create 2 child
 * Node.js processes (RecordProcessor), one for each shard.
